# CSS Loader Animation

This project demonstrates a minimal CSS loader animation using pure CSS and HTML. The loader consists of rotating elements that create a smooth and continuous animation effect.

## Features

- Pure CSS loader animation
- No external dependencies required
- Customizable dimensions and colors

## How It Works

The loader uses CSS keyframe animations to rotate elements and create a spinning effect. The animation is powered by radial gradients and transformations.

### Key Points:

- **Loader Dimensions**: 44.8px by 44.8px
- **Color**: `#554cb5` (You can change this to any color)
- **Animation Duration**: 1.5 seconds, infinitely repeating with a cubic-bezier timing function.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to see the loader in action.
3. Modify the `.loader` class in the CSS file to customize the size, color, or animation speed.

```html
<div class="loader"></div>
